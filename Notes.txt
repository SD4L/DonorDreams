-Features will implement appropriate listeners as needed
-Also, add you name to the authors list of a class if you helped out on it.
Example using UserSettings

Let's say we need to know if the player has god mode.
we would check with...
if((Boolean)DonorDreams.userSettings.getUserSetting("Player name", "isGod"));

If we needed to store or change that value, we would use...
DonorDreams.userSettings.setUserSetting("Player name","isGod", false);
our values get stored as objects, so remember to typecast them when you want them back.
